            <p>

            <p>
                <b>Domain Description:</b> It is catered to the audience who are interested in Humanitarian crisis and social issues around the globe.It works well for novice readers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Data Description:</b> Data focuses on amount of debris in every city of Gaza strip using <i>quantiative data</i> and exponential increase in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Visualization Reflection:</b>  It has used mixuture of techniques like:

                <i>3D Extrusion map</i> of Gaza is presented, where the height of the extrusion  represents weight of the rubble due to destruction.
                
                <i>Colour Coding</i> (Heatmap Style): regions are coloured with varying shades of red, resembling a heatmap.It Probably infers the intensity of destruction in the area.
                
                <i>Map Overlay</i>: It provides familiarity where the base of Map is Gaza strip and the <i>text annotations</i> helps to understand the spatial distribution.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Reflection on Other Narrative Cues and Structuring:</b> It narrates the story in linear manner and combines the pciture and graph with it . Some of these graphics are interactive .It uses a personal story of a Palestinian family how they were uprooted again just after moving to their newly rebuild house. It uses cultural and social cues well for example UN's plan to restore all the heritage monument of Gaza which are older than 2000 years and a 7th century mosque. Use of Mulitple image which are scrollable in horizontal manner and small video helps reader to understand the situation onground and engage more actively with the article.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Personal Thoughts:</b> In my interaction with the article I observed that it is well done on narration part and it conveys it message well with social and cultural cues and a personal story. It works well for new readers. Rhetoric techniques are used well. This article is overall done well but it will be top-notch if it reduces scrolljacking beahaviour which I experienced twice. Apart from this it has done well on visual part too with lots of pictures for setting the story background and making readers familiar with the situation on ground.
